               <p>ThinkTank has a history of producing high quality wrought iron work in Olds, Alberta. Not quite three years ago, the company made a bold move - they switched focus to manufacture large-scale fluid storage solutions for the oil patch. These are really, really big container systems that can hold up to 3,000 cubic meters of water. ThinkTank changed the game in their industry and wanted to help their employees grow and learn alongside the company.</p>

                     <p>"Our workforce is great at what they do, but they don't have a background in leadership. The SAIT training opened the door for dialogue and gave our team a shared skill set to draw from."</p>

               <p>ThinkTank looked for training providers online and discovered SAIT was their top choice. They learned about the Canada Alberta Job Grant through SAIT and the decision was even clearer. Because of the grant, ThinkTank was able to put 11 employees through three consecutive days of training. It was a big commitment to run the shop on a skeleton staff for those days, but the payoff more than made up for it.</p>
               <p>The company had two objectives for their employee training: give supervisors the tools and skills to effectively manage their teams and also learn ways to make the best of use time. They took Supervisory Training and Time Management onsite at SAIT.</p>
               <h2>The solution</h2>
               <h3>What elements of the courses were most useful to your employees?</h3>

               <p>We will tailor training to individual employee needs, focusing on the specific goals and strengths of each person. We will definitely turn to SAIT to help us, and we'll seek out the instructors we had, if possible. They were excellent!</p>
